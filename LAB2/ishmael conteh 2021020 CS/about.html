    <p>As a Catholic school and with Christ as our Patron Saint, Christ the King College, Bo Alumni Association
        celebrates Feast of Christ the King (Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ) in November of each year. Both current
        and past students get together to share countless precious memories of the school where they have learned so
        much, and the home where they made friends for life.

        Christ the King, often simply referred to as CKC with the motto, Adveniat Regnum Tuum (Thy Kingdom Come) is a
        Catholic secondary school in Bo, Sierra Leone’s second-largest city. The school commemorated its 65th
        anniversary in 2018.

        CKC, Bo is the second oldest Catholic secondary school in Sierra Leone after St. Edwards, Freetown. It was
        founded by Catholic Nuns of the Missionary Sisters of the Holy Rosary who serving in the fields of social and
        pastoral work were concerned about the growing number of boys who successfully completed their primary education
        in the region. The nuns found support by including Catholic paramount chiefs in the region, Hotagua of Kakua
        Chiefdom, Foday-Kai of Jaiama Bongor Chiefdom and Kaikai of Kpanga Kabondeh Chiefdom.

        In 1953, these visionary Mothers of the Missionary Sisters of the Holy Rosary together with these chiefs
        solicited the support of the community in establishing a permanent secondary school environment to accommodate
        the growing number of Catholic primary school leavers in this part of Sierra Leone. The Archbishop of the Sierra
        Leone Roman Catholic Mission at the time, Archbishop Thomas Joseph Brosnahan heeded to the call of the Holy
        Rosary Sisters and paramount chiefs. Until CKC was established, primary school leavers in the region ended up at
        either government secondary schools in Bo (the Bo School) and Moyamba (Harford Secondary for Girls) or at St.
        Edwards and St. Joseph’s Secondary schools in Freetown.

    <h2> Brify History of COBA President</h2>

        In 1954 Christ the King College, Bo started off at temporary school buildings at the St. Francis Primary School
        grounds in Bo educating boys who would become leading citizens of Sierra Leone. The first set of students
        included
        the late Gabriel Amara who became the school’s first African Principal, Solomon Berewa, a lawyer and former
        Vice-President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the late Paramount Chief Patrick Moidibor Jaiah Kaikai (PJK), of
        Kpanga Kanbondeh Chiefdom, Pujehun District, the late Bishop Patrick Daniel Koroma, etc.

    <p>
        In 1955 the school moved to its present location on the Njala Komboya Highway. This piece of land was donated by
        the late Paramount Chief Johannes Hotagua of Kakua Chiefdom, Bo District and the foundation stone of the first
        building that houses the principal’s office was laid by the late Paramount Chief B. A. Foday-Kai of Jaiama
        Bongor Chiefdom.

        The revered Irish Priest, Father Michael Corbett, who became the first principal of the new school was
        determined to give students of Christ the King College, Bo a brighter vision of themselves and their future.
        Father Corbett’s notoriety as a disciplined Principal earned him many professional accolades. He served an
        intellectual mentor in the sciences, administrator and religious figurehead. Father Corbett set a path to
        preparing young African boys in classical languages and he equipped science laboratories for science subjects
        that were requirements for acceptance into post-secondary educational institutions in Sierra Leone and Europe.
        This rigid but career-driven preparation earned him praises and endorsements by his former students, some of
        whom became medical practitioners, scientists, and classical language instructors.
